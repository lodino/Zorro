# Zorro
Implementation for paper: Learning from Uncertain Data: From Possible Worlds to Possible Models.

## Building the Environment
1. Download the code.
2. Enter the folder: `cd Zorro`.
3. Install the environment with pip: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Roadmap
* Robustness verification experiments are included in `mpg-robustness-certification.ipynb` and `insurance-robustness-certification.ipynb`.
* Causal inference experiments are included in `Causal Inference.ipynb`.
* Micro-benchmark experiments are included in `micro_bench_test.ipynb`.
* Varying regularization coefficient experiments are included in `mpg-robustness-certification.ipynb`.
